  <p>I am a student at Edison High. I am a freshman, and am planning on taking the computer pathway al through highschool, and seeking a job in computer science later in life. I am of hebrew descent, with my mother from Romania and my father from Israel. Overall, I'm excited to be making this website.</p>
  <p>I always loved computers and working with them. Now I want to know how to make them tick and how to create things with them.</p>
<p>I am a swimmer, and I also love animals. I prefer dogs over much, having my very own standard poodle at home. Overall, I love animals and people.</p>					 </div>
